``` js
// rtmp/index.html
var videoSrc = "http://localhost:8080/hls/<CHANGE_TO_STREAM_PATH>.m3u8";
```

In this case `CHANGE_TO_STREAM_PATH` is `test` but you can change that to whatever you want

<hr>

### This branch separated the stream `auth`


```
$ docker-compose build
```

```
$ docker-compose up
```

`locahost:8080`

### Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
